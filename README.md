Student Grade Tracker - Java & MySQL
The Student Grade Tracker is a console-based application developed in Java that allows users to input, analyze, and manage student grades, while also storing and retrieving the data from a MySQL database.

Features:
Add Grades: Users can input grades for multiple students.
Grade Analysis: The system calculates and displays the average, highest, and lowest grades.
Database Integration: Grades can be saved to or retrieved from a MySQL database for persistent storage.
User-Friendly Options: Simple menu-driven interface for easy navigation between adding grades, viewing analysis, and managing database storage.


Tech Stack:
Java for the core logic and user interaction
JDBC for connecting Java to MySQL
MySQL as the database to store and retrieve student grades


How It Works:
Add Student Grades: Users input grades, which are stored in a list.
Analyze Grades: The system calculates the average, highest, and lowest grades from the list of grades.
Database Integration: The grades can be saved to a MySQL database for persistent storage and later retrieval.

The system supports viewing grades directly from the database.
This project is a practical implementation of database interaction and data analysis using Java, showcasing skills in handling user input, performing data calculations, and working with relational databases.
